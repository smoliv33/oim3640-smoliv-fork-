"""
When to use for loop:

- When we know the exact number of iterations, aka. # of times to repeat a certain code block, for i in range(n)
- When we want to iterate over a collection/sequence, such as 
    - a string
    - a list
    - a tuple
    - a dictionary
    - a set


When to use while loop:

- When we don't know the exact number of times to repeat, and we only know when or at what condition to not stop
- when we want to repeatedly execute a block of code forever until at certain condition it breaks out/returns (in a function)
