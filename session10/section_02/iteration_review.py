"""
When to use for loop:

- When we know the exact number of iterations, aka. the # of times to repeat a code block
- When we want to iterate through a collection of items or a sequence, such as
    - a string
    - a list
    - a tuple
    - a dictionary
    - a set

traversal


When to use while loop:

- When we don't know the exact number of iterations, aka. the # of times to repeat a code block, but we know when or at what contidition to not stop
- when we want to repetively execute a block of code forever, until at some condition it breaks out/returns (in a function)
